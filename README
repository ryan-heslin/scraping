This repository contains a few scripts I wrote that use the Selenium module
for webscraping. formfiller.py contains code for creating FormFiller objects 
that configure Selenium to send specified text to forms on a selected website;
form_filelr_driver.py defines a command-line interface for creating such
objects; and clipboard2pastebin.py is a simple utility to generate Pastebin
links to input text.

Usage Notes

Once created, a FormFiller object may be modified using the add, remove,
clear, and update methods.n the Python console. When creating FormFiller objects on the command
line, note that the storage argument takes a relative path to the intended
shelve storage file from Python's working directory. If the object appears not
to have been saved to the correct file, a working directory issue is probably
the reason.
